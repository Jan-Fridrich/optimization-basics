# Optimization-basics
Some basic optimization algorithms visualized.  
## Gradient descent
For now just simple 2D Gradient descent animation for visualization. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)  
The function can by changed as the gradient is computed numerically.  

## Color map
The color map file is a altered version of MATLAB 'turbo' colormap with more pronounced extremes.
